# Lost and Found Project

## Overview
The Lost and Found project is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of reporting and claiming lost items within a college campus. Developed by a team of students from the Department of Computer Engineering at Hope Foundation's International Institute of Information Technology, Pune, this project aims to solve the common issue of misplaced personal belongings in large institutional settings.

## Problem Statement
In large institutions with thousands of students, it's often challenging for individuals to locate lost items or for finders to identify the rightful owners. This project provides a centralized platform for announcing lost and found items, facilitating easier recovery of personal belongings.

## Features
- User registration and login system
- Reporting of lost items
- Tracking of found items
- Verification process for item authenticity
- Secure communication between item owners and finders
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go access
- Location-based search for matching records
- Notification alerts for relevant new cases
- Case closure for resolved items

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Java (Eclipse IDE)
- Database: MySQL (XAMPP)
- Server: Apache Tomcat

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the MySQL database using XAMPP
